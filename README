This utility, gpsread, started as small program to pull NMEA data off a ND-100s
dongle, with the output going to a shell script. It got tidied up and made
more general, less hard-compiled defaults. As such it was an excercise in
learning libConfuse configuration parsing library.

I've released it under the GPLv2 and the BSD 2 clause license. Pick one.

Installation:
  $ make
  $ sudo make install
By default the installation prefix, set in Makefile, is /usr/local And so this
will install $(PREFIX)/bin/gpsread and $(PREFIX)/man/man1/gpsread.1.gz

A typical NMEA sentence that this utility expects:
  $GPGGA,170643.000,5237.7238,N,00115.1283,E,1,04,7.4,26.1,M,47.0,M,,0000*6A

This has been tested on 1 dongle, on 4 different operating systems, at 3 locations.
I wouldn't use it for your-life-may-depend-on-it navigation, and you shouldn't either.
